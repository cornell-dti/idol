                  Ready, Set, Make is an annual make-a-thon our team hosts for
                  5th and 6th grade students! We invite students in the local
                  community to Cornell and how they can use design thinking to
                  solve problems that they encounter. Their energy and
                  creativity was contagious, and team members and kids alike
                  were building incredible prototypes out of cardboard and craft
                  supplies! DTI partnered with Makerspace to give an
                  introduction to 3D printing using Tinkercad.

                  DTI Blueprint is a training program designed to teach students
                  about design and product thinking from team membersâ€™ own
                  experience. Over several weeks, DTI team members gave
                  workshops on concepts like user research, product ideation,
                  and minimum viable products. Students formed groups and
                  brainstormed a problem to solve on campus and came up with a
                  testable solution.
