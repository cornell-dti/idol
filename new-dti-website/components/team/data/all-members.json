My family is from France and Singapore; je parle français 🇫🇷 and 我在学中文 🇨🇳 (I speak French and I’m learning Chinese).\n\n💼 I started designing when I was 13, creating mock-ups in Google Slides, before I discovered Figma. Since then, I’ve interned and freelanced with companies like Replit, General Counsel AI, and most recently, at a Roblox game called Deadline. My favorite things to design are design systems, presentation decks, and micro-details that make an experience memorable. I also do frontend programming and frequently code my designs.\n\n🎨 For me, design is about building meaningful connection between people and the world around them. I believe in the power of human-centered design and accessibility – ”Solve for one, extend to many.” I aim to balance aesthetics and functionality, ensuring every creation is both beautiful and practical. Quality and attention to detail are central to my work, but I also strive to create moments of joy that elevate the user experience.\n\n🏓 Outside of design, I enjoy playing piano and ping pong, though not at the same time. I’m also an avid reader – whether it’s news or literature, I love staying curious about the world.\n\n📧 Please feel free to get in touch! :)"

I'm interested in pursuing design education, design education experiences, game design, journalism or product design (UI/UX centered)\n\nOutside of design, I’m fond of writing stories, filming video essay and baking pizza & pastries. Let's talk about designing products, reading autobiographies, or soft pop recommendations!",
