As a Chinese American who grew up in Brazil, I have a passion for design that positively transforms the visual, built, and virtual environment. My blend of cultures offers me a unique, complex perspective that inspires my work. In the past, I have interned as a UX designer for Mastercard. On campus, you can find me doodling, building puzzles, playing the New York Times mini crossword and probably sipping on boba in Mann library.","major":"Design & Environmental Analysis","hometown":"Sao Paulo (Brazil)","formerSubteams":["samwise"],"role":"designer","graduation":"May 2021","netid":"vls63"},{"about":"Hey! I'm Will, a senior and developer on DTI. I love to spend my time coding and helping out the community.

Outside of developing, I spend my time gaming and following politics, so I can commonly be found yelling at my computer due to a broken controller or some scandalous news story.","github":"https://github.com/willespencer","roleDescription":"Developer","subteams":["courseplan"],"role":"developer","lastName":"Spencer","pronouns":"he/him","doubleMajor":null,"minor":"Public Policy, Information Science, Game Design","major":"Computer Science","website":null,"netid":"wes229","email":"wes229@cornell.edu","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/willespencer/","formerSubteams":["nova"],"hometown":"Tysons, VA","graduation":"May 2022","firstName":"Will"},{"lastName":"Kang","formerSubteams":["clubhub"],"email":"wk228@cornell.edu","graduation":"May 2022","major":"Computer Science","roleDescription":"Developer","website":"https://woosang.io","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/woosang","role":"developer","github":"https://github.com/paul-kang-1","pronouns":"","subteams":["zing"],"about":"Hi!
