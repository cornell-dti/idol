I joined DTI my sophomore fall, and was a PM on CUApts for three semesters and a PM lead for one semester. I'm currently advising wherever I can help on DTI :) Career-wise, I'm going for SWE, and I interned at Etsy this summer on a product engineering team.\n\nOutside of DTI, I'm a campus tour guide, an Engineering peer advisor, a TA for CS 2110, and a member of the dance group Base Productions. I love to cook, bake, read, dance, travel, and quote pop culture references. \n\nPlease reach out if you want to talk about DTI, product, SWE, or anything outside of that!! ",
